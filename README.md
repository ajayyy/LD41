# How to play

The instructions can be found on screen as well.

To play, click on the screen to repel the liquid away, try to guide it into the holes.

There are two progress bars on the side, one tells you how much liquid you have left to push out, and the other tells you how much longer you can hold the mouse (you have a limit to make it difficult)

Donâ€™t hit into red areas.

Good luck!

# How is it made

This is made with Lib-GDX, a Java library that acts as a wrapper for LWJGL (Open GL for Java). This library allows you to compile you game for almost every platform, including Web.

The physics simulations are done with Box-2D. There are shaders also used to make it look like liquid.
